# Resource-Dependence-and-Economic-Complexity
Master Thesis

Current files represent all scripts and data sets (used or created) deployed in the Master Thesis on Economic Complexity and Resource Dependence. As the dataset on international trade is over 25 Mb, it cannot be uploaded here. It is publicly available here (zip-file "country_sitcproduct2digit_year.zip"): https://intl-atlas-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Scripts start with 0, 1 or 2. 
- Scripts starting with 0 contain code for the preparatory stage where I download and prepare data for further transformations and analysis.
- Scripts starting with 1 contain code for data transformations.
- Scripts starting with 2 contain code for model estimation (and FOD tranformation).
